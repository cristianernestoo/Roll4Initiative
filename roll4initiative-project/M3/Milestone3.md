# Milestone 3: Wireframe - [roll4initiative]

## Wireframe
To address this purpose we leveraged Balsamiq to merge the interfaces of the two prototypes in M2. We focused on the main approach of prototype 1, "game setup", and considered the advice derived from evaluations to fix its interaction issues.  
We chose the "Voice call" wireframe because it where the main activity of our webapplication is performed, it gives access to the majority of the functionalities like communicating and managing the communication with other players as well as sharing game assets (dice, manuals...).

In the wireframes, additional screenshots have been added to show some graphic feedbacks or important pop-ups of the screens, based on the role of the user in the specific game session.
