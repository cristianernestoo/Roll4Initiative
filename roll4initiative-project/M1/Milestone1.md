# Milestone 1: Project description and Needfinding: [roll4initiative]



## Overview and planning


Our project idea is to support RPG players during an online session and make it as enjoyable as the game in presence. For this purpose we chose to observe two different type of matches played in a videocall: one for 'Dungeons&Dragons' and one for 'Lupus in Fabula'. Therefore, we identified three types of personas described here after.

## Personas

- **Novice** : few or none expierence at all in the game. This one is particularly important to observe because, since these kind of games have many specific rules, they need support during the experience. Therefore, their behavior could create unexpected situations. 
- **Experienced players** : skilled players with lot of experience and knowledge of rules and "tools". 
- **Narrator** : experienced player who covered the narrator role: a common figure present in different RPGs. 

## Observation

The activities we observed are two online sessions of the following popular RPGs: "Dungeons&Dragons" and "Lupus in fabula". We chose these games because, even if they follow similar patterns (narrator, roles, different game phases etc...), they differ in many aspects like: secret vs. public roles, easiness and quantity of rules, game assets, set up complexity and overall duration of the session. Therefore we had the chance to observe the maximum range of possible uncofortable situations. 
The activty was done observing one session of "Dungeons&Dragons" for two hours and one match of "Lupus in fabula" for 30 minutes, both played using the Discord platform. The "Dungeons&Dragons" session consisted of two novice players, three experienced players and one narrator. Instead, the "Lupus in fabula" match consisted of two novice players, four experienced players and one narrator.
<br/>
A common issue we found in this type of games when played online on generic video-chat platforms is **communication**. 
Since these are games based on "storytelling" and are often divided in different moments that need separate voice channels based on the roles covered, a player had to open another call using another software. If the same software was used for both the calls, the secret role would have been revealed and the match would have been invalidated.

### Novice player:

This kind of situation also happened when a novice player tried to ask for help or clarification about the game to an experienced one without interrupting it (this call wasn't actually used in the end). 
Moreover, an external software was used to send the rules manual to the novice player. For an experienced player was quite slow to show them the exact page and place where to find the required information.

### Narrator:

From the narrator prospective another **communication** related issue was the overlapping of the voices. Actually, this is a common situation when these kind of games are played in presence, but online it is amplified due to the fact that there is no eye contact so a player does not know when is their turn to talk.
<br/>
<br/>
During the "Dungeons&Dragons" battle fight session the narrator used the webcam to display the game board (initially the idea was to use an app that exploits the camera of the smartphone as a webcam, but the operation was too hard to setup for the narrator). The other players continuously asked them for clarifications about the position of the pawns because the quality of streaming and the view did not allow a simple understanding of the evolution of the play.

### Experienced and Novice Player:

First of all there was the widespread difficulty of clearly framing the result of the dice with the webcam.
Then we also noticed the trouble for a novice player not to get confused between the different types of dice to roll in the various situations in which they are required. Some players, also, did not even own the dices and used external apps or asked to another one to roll the dice for them. In the first case they could easily cheat by rolling different times in order to get a good result.

## Interviews


<br/>

### **Questions:**

We decided to keep question as general as possible (for what concerns the two games mentioned before) both because the situations were similar and because we wanted the interviewed person to stick firtstly to the most painful issues ecountered. The follow up questions are the ones in the square brackets.

<br/>

- **What was the first issue that you encountered during the experience?**["In what sense?" "Why?"]

<br/>

> Novice: "I could not be able to play the role because of the lack of confidence with the other players. I thought I would not have this problem in person. Also I had issues with understanding the story, the mechanics, the manual and also the play board. I wish the other players could share and indicate better where to look for." 

> Experienced: "I found it difficult to share information/game materials with the other players and draw attention to specific sections of them."

> Narrator: "As a narrator it was difficult to keep control over the players' dialogues due to the general noise and the equal volume of each player voice; I wish there was a way to easily mute everyone when needed."

<br/>

- **I noticed that, during the game, the dice result was shown via webcam or directly communicated by voice. Do you think the result may have been changed by the other players?** [For the novice: "You made the other players roll the dice for you, why?"]

<br/>

> Novice: "I could not know if the results were faked so I think it would have been better for us to use a shared simulator. I asked the other players to roll the dice for me because I was afraid to roll the wrong one." 

> Experienced: "I think it was hard to prove that the dice result was not faked and using an online pseudo-random generator didn't give the impression that the result was really random. Perhaps using a true random website would be better, but we still want the sensation that the "responsibility" for the roll is our own. I think the best trade-off would be a physics simulator system but I don't know any. "

> Narrator: " I wish there was a way to share the dice results (maybe automatically computed) except the ones of the narrator, due to the game rules. Indeed I found it hard to read the result of dices rolled by other players. It would be surely more enjoyable." 

<br/>

- **Did you need the manual of the game?**[Did you need to share it?]

<br/>

> Novice: "Yes, I needed to use both the manual and the character sheet which were displayed on a different device. " 

> Experienced: "Yes of course, but I did not have the time to send the manual to other players. It should have been useful to share it especially for the novice player."

> Narrator: "I mostly remember it, except for the spells. I would have liked to show it to other players." 

<br/>

- **I noticed that you opened another call with an external person? Why so?**[Why, at the end, did not you use that?]

<br/>

> Novice: "I opened another call to ask for clarification because I did not wanted to interrupt the game. I did not use it because it was too complex to manage at the same time." 

<br/>

- **I noticed that the narrator chose an object for your character while the other player did that on their own, why?**

<br/>

> Novice: "I did not understand i had to make the choice. The lag and the voices overlapping made it difficult to clearly understand what was going on. " 

<br/>

- **Did you encounter any issues about keeping the role secret?**

<br/>

> Novice: "Players created other channels to keep their role secret, but again it was too tricky to manage. That experience was not satisfying because we spent most of the time switching channels instead of enjoying the experience." 

<br/>

- **How was helping a novice player online?**[For the experienced:"the novice said they did not get much about the game, what do you think about it?"]

<br/>

> Experienced: "I think the only problem in helping the novice player was to indicate where to find the information; actually I didn't get when the novice player was having issues."

> Narrator: "I found hard to help novice player, who could not fully understand what could or couldn't be done; I wish I could show the manual, the character sheet, the board and so on to the other players. However, the character sheets should only be visible to the owner and the narrator to avoid unfair plays."

<br/>

- **Are there alternative solution, apart from Discord?**[Why did you not use that?]

<br/> 

> Experienced: "I think another solution (roll20) is too long to set up, especially for unexperienced users, but having a virtual shared board (with nice movable custom characters) is really useful and cool. At the end we still prefer Discord for communication and real dices: the additional features to be used elsewhere aren't that many."

> Narrator: "I know about a website to play rpg sessions (Roll20). We didn't use Roll20 because I know it is really hard and boring to set up and I am are not really practical with complex interfaces."

<br/>

- **I noticed that at the beginning of the game you believed that your character was behind someone else's back, but the narrator quickly pointed out that this was not the case. How come you got confused?**

<br/>

> Experienced: "The narrator should have shown the battle board from the start in order to avoid this issue."

<br/>

- **I have noticed that you guys care a lot about a good portrayal of the character, trying to act as if you only know what your character knows about. If two characters are far apart, is the player still required to listen to what the other is saying?**

<br/>

> Experienced: "I believe that it is appropriate to let the narrator decide what the players should or should not listen to, trying not to make them getting bored. "

<br/>

- **If, during the story, the party splits into separate groups, how would you manage the narration with Discord?**

<br/>

> Narrator: "I think it could be more realistic to have different voice channels (where only I can move players) in case of party splitting or particular situations."

<br/>

- **Who would you let decide the parts of the story that anyone can listen to?**

<br/>

> Experienced: "The narrator should decide, with the proper amount of common sense."

> Narrator: "The current narrator should be able to manage the group of players in order not to make them get bored."

<br/>

- **Is that something I should have asked for?**
  
<br/>

> Novice: "I thought you should have asked me if my experience was fun. Actually I had fun but I guess I could enjoy it even more if the session was less chaotic and better organized." 

> Experienced: "Maybe you should have asked about the voice overlapping issues. I wish there was a way to emulate the eye contact in order to make other players aware of the moments when is my turn to talk."

> Narrator: "I think you have already asked me everything."

<br/>

## User Needs

1. Sometimes during the game specific players should not be able to talk in/listen specific conversation. Therefore the narrator needs a way to decide who can listen/talk and when.
2. All the players need to be able to share materials (board, dice, rules, character sheets).
3. The novice player sometimes ask for help during the game and interrupts it. They need a way to talk with other players privately.
4. All the players need a way to automatically compute the final result of the dice rolled plus the character stats and show it to other players.
5. Sometimes, the players need a personal space where to upload their game assets and keep them secret.

## Project Description


Among all the different user needs found in the previous step, we figured out that the most critical ones, which are also the ones most of the interviewed people have insisted on, are the first and the second. To address these user needs we thought of a smartphone webapp, that covers some common features of the RPGs (as previously highligthed), that allows a narrator to set up a call, in which all the other players can join and get their roles assigned. The narrator can also select who can talk/listen in a specific moment and upload common material so that other players can visualize them.
